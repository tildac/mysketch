### Fast Fashion // Slow Fashion  

![Mathilda Christensson](images/MyWork.png?raw=true "Mathilda Christensson") 

This is my updated sketch that I have renamed "Fast Fashion//Slow Fashion". Some elements of the sketch are the same. For example the names of the fashion brands are still fast fashion versus sustainable fashion. However, I wanted to simplify the design further. Now, the boundary between the two different fashion systems is identified by a downward slope of moving circles on repeat. This is meant to represent the continuous divide that exists within the tension of the fashion industry. Furthermore, I have cast black strokes across the fast fashion brands to emphasize their destructive nature, which is also highlighted by the landfill sight in the background. The green foliage on the side with the sustainable brands is representative of the ethical approach this aspect of the fashion industry adopts. I allowed for the green mouse with the recycling symbol to remain as I still feel as though this highlights to the consumer the theme of the graphic. I prefer this interactive graphic to my previous version. I feel as though this shows the direct contrast between the two systems, in a more attention grabbing manner. With the moving circles and the ray of black strokes it is clear to the consumer which side of the page they should be on, and how they should begin to shift their attitude in terms of consumption. I also feel as though this sketch is more in tune with my own aesthetic. The color choice not only works with the subject matter elected, but is cleaner and the tones are more aesthetically pleasing.
